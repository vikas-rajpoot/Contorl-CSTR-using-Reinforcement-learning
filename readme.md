## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow the steps below to set up the project environment.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Control-CSTR-using-Reinforcement-learning.git
    cd Control-CSTR-using-Reinforcement-learning
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Set up the environment and install dependencies as mentioned in the [Installation](#installation) section.
2. Run simulations or experiments using the scripts provided in the `Simulation` directory.
3. Utilize the utility functions from the `Utils` directory for tasks such as plotting results or calculating metrics.

### Running a Simulation

To run a simulation, you can use the `simulator.py` script. For example:
```sh
python Simulation/simulator.py
```

## Examples

Here is an example of how to run a basic simulation and plot the results:

```python
from Env.env import CSTR
from Simulation.simulator import run_simulation
from Utils.ploting import plot_results

# Initialize the CSTR environment
env = CSTR()

# Run the simulation
results = run_simulation(env)

# Plot the results
plot_results(results)
```
